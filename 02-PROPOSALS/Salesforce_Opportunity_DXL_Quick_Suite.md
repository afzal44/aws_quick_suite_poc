2. **Tableau + Salesforce Einstein**
   - Limitation: Limited autonomous action execution capabilities
   - Weaker integration with AWS data ecosystem

3. **Google Cloud Vertex AI + Looker**
   - Limitation: Would require complete infrastructure migration
   - Higher total cost of ownership

4. **Custom Build (Internal Development)**

- Cost: Lower conversion rates, higher return rates

**5. Slow Response to Market Volatility**
- Current State: Static forecasting models, slow adaptation to demand shifts
- Impact: Inability to capitalize on sudden trends or mitigate supply disruptions
- Cost: Lost revenue during peak demand, excess inventory during downturns

**6. Technical Debt & Legacy BI Tools**
- Current State: MicroStrategy requires SQL knowledge, limiting self-service analytics
- Impact: BI team bottleneck, delayed insights for business users
- Cost: Opportunity cost of slow data-driven decision-making

**7. Compliance & Governance Complexity**
- Current State: Manual synthesis of regulatory updates across multiple regions
- Impact: Risk of non-compliance, slow policy adaptation
