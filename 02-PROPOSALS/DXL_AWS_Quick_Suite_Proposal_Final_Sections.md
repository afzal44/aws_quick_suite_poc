# DXL AWS Quick Suite Proposal - Final Sections

## 10. Recommendations & Next Steps

### 10.1 Executive Recommendation

**We recommend immediate approval and implementation of AWS Quick Suite for DXL.**

**Rationale:**
1. **Compelling ROI**: 452% Year 1 ROI with 2.2-month payback period
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Directly supports FitMap investment and omnichannel strategy
3. **Low Risk**: AWS-native solution with proven enterprise deployments
4. **Competitive Advantage**: First-mover advantage in specialty retail AI adoption
5. **Scalable Foundation**: Platform grows with business needs

### 10.2 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

**Step 1: Executive Approval (Week 1)**
- Present proposal to Executive Leadership Team
- Secure budget approval ($243,380 Year 1)
- Assign executive sponsor (recommend: CTO or VP Operations)
- Establish steering committee

**Step 2: Project Kickoff (Week 2)**
- Engage AWS Professional Services
- Assemble internal project team
- Finalize implementation schedule
- Communicate initiative to organization

**Step 3: Environment Provisioning (Week 2)**
- Provision Quick Suite in AWS account
- Configure IAM roles and security
- Begin data integration planning

### 10.3 Decision Framework

**Approve if:**
- ✓ Strategic priority to improve data-driven decision-making
- ✓ FitMap/SizeStream investment requires better analytics
- ✓ Current BI tools (MicroStrategy, Excel) are insufficient
- ✓ Budget available ($243K Year 1, $164K ongoing)
- ✓ Executive sponsorship secured

**Defer if:**
- ✗ Other critical IT initiatives must take priority
- ✗ Organizational readiness concerns (major restructuring)
- ✗ Budget constraints require delay

**Alternative if deferring:**
- Pilot FitMap use case only (reduced scope: $80K, 4 weeks)
- Validate ROI before full implementation
- Scale up in Q2 2026

### 10.4 Success Factors

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Executive Sponsorship**: Active CTO/VP Operations engagement
2. **User Champions**: 10-15 power users driving adoption
3. **Change Management**: Comprehensive training and communication
4. **Quick Wins**: FitMap use case success in first 30 days
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Monthly optimization cycles

**Warning Signs to Monitor:**
- User adoption <60% after 90 days
- System performance issues (>10 sec query response)
- ROI tracking shows <70% benefit realization
- High user frustration (satisfaction <65%)

### 10.5 Long-Term Vision (12-24 Months)

**Phase 4: Advanced AI Capabilities (Months 13-18)**
- Predictive analytics for demand forecasting
- AI-powered product recommendations
- Automated competitive intelligence
- Customer lifetime value modeling

**Phase 5: Enterprise Expansion (Months 19-24)**
